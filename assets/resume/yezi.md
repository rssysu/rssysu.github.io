:   **BEng, Artificial Intelligence; Sun Yat-sen University**

    * Thesis title: Research on GPU-Optimized Fast Retrieval Model for Medical Image Vector Data
    * Advisor: [Assoc. Prof. Libin Zheng]

Research Experience
----------

**Evolutionary Multi-task Optimization for Multi-task Reinforcement Learning**

- Participated in a five-member team to apply evolutionary algorithms to multi-task deep reinforcement learning.
- Conducted a literature review on evolutionary-guided RL methods, identifying key limitations in cross-task optimization.
- Implemented MFEA and A-MFEA-RL in Python to evolve multiple deep Q-learning models simultaneously.
- Advisor: [Assoc. Prof. Zefeng Chen](https://sai.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/228)

**Research on GPU-Optimized Fast Retrieval Model for Medical Image Vector Data**

- Conducted a comprehensive review of large-scale vector retrieval methods.
- Introduced an ROI-scoring mechanism that combines ResNet-based disease classification with U-Net segmentation.
- Developed a class-weightâ€“aware scheduling strategy and cache-eviction policy that prevents rare-disease clusters from being evicted prematurely.
